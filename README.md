# Go (Golang) Studies

Welcome to my Go (Golang) studies repository! This repository contains notes, exercises, and small projects as I explore and learn the Go programming language.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of my learnings and experiments with Go. The content ranges from basic syntax to more advanced topics such as concurrency, web development, and more.

## Installation

To get started with Go, you'll need to install it on your machine.

1. Visit the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the latest version of Go.
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

To verify that Go is installed correctly, run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
go version go1.x.x linux/amd64
```

## Basic Commands

Here are some essential Go commands that you'll use frequently:

### 1. Initialize a New Module

```bash
go mod init <module-name>
```

This command initializes a new Go module, creating a `go.mod` file.

### 2. Run a Go Program

```bash
go run <file.go>
```

This command compiles and runs the specified Go file.

### 3. Build a Go Program

```bash
go build <file.go>
```

This command compiles the Go program into an executable binary.

### 4. Test Go Code

```bash
go test ./...
```

This command runs all tests in the current module.

### 5. Get a Package

```bash
go get <package-path>
```

This command downloads and installs the specified package.

### 6. Update Dependencies

```bash
go get -u ./...
```

This command updates all dependencies to their latest versions.

### 7. Format Go Code

```bash
go fmt ./...
```

This command formats your Go code according to the Go standards.

### 8. Lint Go Code

```bash
go vet ./...
```

This command examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs.

### 9. Tidy Up Dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This command cleans up the `go.mod` file by removing unnecessary dependencies.
